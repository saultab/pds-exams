# Pds rust exams

The purpose of this repository is to collect all the exam topics of the API programming part, for the course held by prof. Giovanni Malnati at Politecnico di Torino.

## Description

ALL EXAM TRACKS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN IN A BLOCK COMMENT

All tracks are solved and COME WITH A FUNCTIONING MAIN to let you execute them for your understanding: in the actual exam the main() function is not required. 

The .rs files named with a date relate to the corresponding exam session.
In addition there are undated .rs files which are from to old exams that required writing code in C++, of course updated to the Rust language.

Some solutions are print and/or comment heavy, we hope that might be useful for your understanding
